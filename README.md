# Arden Wolfsky's Website

Extremely modified version of [mere-blog-theme](https://github.com/chrisrhymes/mere-blog-theme).

## Setup
These should work, but are fine tuned for my own use case.
1. Run the build scripts
    * `build.sh` for Linux.
    * `build.ps1` for Windows.
## Scripts
* `generate_tag.py` and `generate_category.py`

These are both used to generate tag and category pages. On each page, there is a pagination configured to list all posts for that tag/category.
## License
The theme is available as open source under the terms of the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).
